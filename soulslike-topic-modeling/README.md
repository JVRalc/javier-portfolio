# Soulslike Topic Modeling

## I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to find discussion topics among Soulslike video games. I wanted to know what things did players like or dislike about Soulslikes

* The games I analyzed for this project are:

        -Lies of P
        -Lords of the Fallen
        -Remnant II
        -Star Wars: Jedi Survivor
        -Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty
* You can find the LDA model for each game in the .ipynb file located in each of their folders. They are labeled:

        - [GAME-NAME]-final.ipynb

* You can also find the review datasets I used (as well as the data scraping code) in the folder data-collection

* Thank you!!!
